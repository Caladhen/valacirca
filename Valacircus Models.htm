</span>HP:235 EP:235> 
Standing with the strength and grace of a Mallorn tree,
this willowy Sindas head is tipped skywards, her eyes
gazing at something you cannot see. In her hand she holds a
naked blade, glinting in the candle light. The point of
thin steel hovers mere inches above her face, perilously close
to her full lips. The pommel of the sword is gripped tightly in
her hand, inlaid with gems carved into the shape of teardrops.
She is clothed in a soft gray tunic and tights. On the left
shoulder of her tunic, emblazoned in silver, is a series of seven 
silver stars cascading down the sleeves, matching those on her
tights and boots.

Jairak Adanorod the dunedain and <span class="fore1">fearless</span> <span class="fore4">tamer</span> of <span class="fore6">taraxacum
</span>HP:235 EP:235> 
This Dunedain's dark cloak is travelworn and dirty around the hem
looking as if it has spent more nights under the stars in the wilds
of Arda rather than an inn room.  His hair is short and well kept 
from what is seen under his hood and his face has been recently 
shaved.  A knife seems to be his most prized possesions for it is 
oiled and very sharp, perhaps that is how he keeps away the stubble 
on his face.  His bright blue eyes are penetrating and seem to 
notice everything.

Jairak is a Sergeant in the army of Gondor
with 0 wins and 0 losses.
 He is carrying:

HP:235 EP:235> 
    This model depicts a young dunadan ranger soaring high above the 
crowd, performing death-defying stunts on a flying trapeze.  The sequined 
gems on his blue and yellow jumpsuit glitter brightly in the light, in a
flamboyant display of Caladhen's comfort in his own masculinity.  Hanging 
by his knees from the trapeze, Caladhen should be preparing to catch the 
man who is flying toward him; however, he has instead positioned himself 
above Sere's act with an impish grin and a frog in hand.  The small, lit
firework that sticks from the frog's mouth leaves little to be imagined 
as to what unfolded shortly after this model's model was modeled.

<span class="fore8">J</span>ust over six feet in height and built like a refined whip of steel, this
Silvan mingles the sharp graces of elderhood with the tempered hardness 
of a field veteran.  His raven-dark hair, transitioning to silver with
time, crowns a straight, narrow nose, stern cheekbones, firm mouth, and
acute violet eyes that remain keen despite the evident weight of age.
<span class="fore8">T</span>his master of the impalement arts has dozens of blades visible on his 
person, and the faint outlines visible at times beneath his clothes hint
at hidden others.  Atop his black travel leathers trimmed in purple, he

hosting a regiment of light steel spikes awaiting deployment, and a lean
dagger in his right boot.  Around his waist, a cotton sash is chased with
silver tengwar, blessings for wind and balance to ever be in his favor.

Irun Lathandyr the dunedain <span class="fore12">Fire </span><span class="fore4">Eater</span> of <span class="fore10">Valacircus
</span>HP:235 EP:235> 
You are about to wet your pants in fear when you see Irun, coming up
through the happy crowd of 20th Two Towers Event, with two flaming swords
in hands. He is wearing a sleeveless leather jacket which leaves his bare
chest open and wide, comfortable, red pants that are coupled with pointy
mojari shoes... and he seems to swallow the blades in a blink of the eye.
You wish you blink your eyes, when he blows out <span class="fore4">FLAMES</span> out of his mouth!
You try to escape for your life but stumble and fall to the ground, as he
waves the blades with a skill beyond master swordsman. You are about to
lose your hope, when your eyes catch a glimpse of an acrobat moving
around and laughing at you... then you stare at a strong(wo)man throwing
up heavy balls of metal to air (damn, she winks at you!)...

Grimlod Runeaxe the dwarf <span class="fore12">Bearded Lady </span>of<span class="fore10"> VALACIRCUS!
</span>HP:235 EP:235> 
You see before you a dwarf with brown hair tied into a long
plait at the nape of his neck. His grey-blue eyes seem to
twinkle as you look into his face. It seems to be that
of a pleasant sort of fellow, though the odd nick and
scratch here and there betray a life of fighting in 
the sevrice of the light. Most peculiar is the full
length beard with eight forked plaits that frame his
face. Perhaps added to the curiosity is the fact
that he is dressed in an eye-wateringly revealing
black silk negligee, suspender belt and sheer
black stockings. You feel distinctly sick at the sight.

  Somber grey eyes command this Dúnadan's deadpan visage. Fine cheek
bones and a nearly straight nose are set above a small mouth and firm
chin. Braided auburn pigtails stick out comically from beneath a bright
purple, three-pointed fools hat, tipped with bells.  
  A long sleeved satin tunic of the same purple is embroidered in emerald
green swirls and diamonds and belted with rope, dyed golden.  Her legs
are clad in emerald hose and her feet in soft purple slippers with
upturned toes.  In each hand is a frog, and lo, before her face are two
more - this woman seems to be juggling them!

Foraker Stonewolf the dwarf General of Gondor (Fighting!)
HP:235 EP:235> 
Before you stands a stout dwarf.  A grey cloak is cast about him, but
beneath it you catch the glitter of shining mail and his hand resting upon
the ornate hilt of a sword.  His hood is thrown back, and his stern face gazes
straight at you, seeming to look right into your heart.  The dwarf's hair and 
beard are black but streaked with grey, while his eyes are the color
of steel.  On his chest hangs a gold and mithril pendant depicting two trees.

a slapstick, or could that be a staff?

Erwin of Valacirca the dunedain Old Man
HP:235 EP:235> 
 
Erwin stands a little over six feet tall, and looks to be in his thirties.  Thick shoulder-length black hair is tied back in braids, and two piercing grey eyes scan the area. His face is tanned but smooth, except for a scar running from his right eye across his cheek.
 
Erwin holds the Staff of the Valacirca in hand.  Through this staff he channels the power to defeat his enemies, and you know just by the confidence with which he holds it that he has seen many victorious battles.

He has the look of a <span class="fore9">t</span><span class="fore12">r</span><span class="fore10">i</span><span class="fore14">b</span><span class="fore9">e</span><span class="fore12">s</span><span class="fore10">m</span><span class="fore14">a</span><span class="fore9">n</span>!

Peering back at you from within a dark, weather-stained hooed cloak, are two <span class="fore11">silver</span>-<span class="fore1">blue</span> eyes that have a stern, yet somewhat warm gaze. His worn, black cloak is wrapped around him, hiding what he holds from the view of strangers. He lets the cloak open for a moment and you get a glimpse of a black and <span class="fore12">red</span> leather tunic underneath. Dark bracers wrap around his wrists and forearms and he wears gloves with the fingers missing. You spot a knife poking out of his boot, along with a <span class="fore11">sapphire</span> hilted knife sticking through his belt. Strapped to his back is a very plain sword, but long as he is tall.
 
He whisks the cloak around him again and you see only black one more, dotted by those two eyes.

You attempt to check his inventory, but are much too drunk.
